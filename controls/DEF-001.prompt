DEF-001 - Clearly define the core of service offering (what, who, and how).

# Requirements

This is the foundation of your service offering. It must provide customers with details of your technical capabilities and experience on the service offering to make an informed decision.

- Service details including reference architecture diagram if applicable, use cases and AWS value proposition
- Characteristics and profiles of target customers
- Customer engagement and delivery mechanisms

# Criteria for Passing

- Provide a public landing page that describes your offer specifics related with AWS, OR,
- Partner website, AWS Marketplace listing, or any other publicly accessible link qualifies

# Why is this important?

It provides clear value proposition and technical expertise so that customers can assess if this fits their use case.

# How can you implement this?

You can create a publicly accessible page from homepage by highlighting specific practice, solutions on AWS, or leveraged AWS services related with the offer. You should consider including customer reference if applicable.

When creating a reference architecture diagram, it’s important that the diagrams indicate primary AWS native services, demonstrate major networking components and how components communicate with users over the internet.

# Unacceptable/Incomplete responses

Response is unacceptable or doesn’t have the sufficient information when:
- Partner doesn't have a public URL for the listed offer
- Partner response doesn’t really indicate AWS relevance
- Response doesn't have all three components - who, what & how.
- No architecture diagram included for an offer involving hands-on implementation
</assessment-criteria>

Base on the assessment criteria above, critically evaluate the partner's response below:

<partner-response>
$partner
</partner-response>

Then answer the following questions base only on the partner's response, repeating the question before each answer. 

<questions>
1. What grading would you give for the partner's response from a scale of 1 to 100, and why?
2. What is the service offering about, and how does it relate to AWS Cloud?
3. Which specific type of clients is the service offering targetted at?
4. What is the partner's engagement and delivery mechanism such as timelines, sequence of steps? Essentially, what can the customer expect?
5. What is the provided public URL for this service offering? If it is not provided, then this response is less-compliant.
